Entice more affiliates to register by offering them a sign up bonus

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

Offering a sign up bonus is a great way to entice more affiliates to register on your site.
In turn these affiliates will go on to promote your products and services, making you more sales.

**How it works**

When an affiliate registers through the AffiliateWP registration form, or you
manually add an affiliate from within the admin, a sign up bonus will be awarded
(amount set from within the settings). This bonus is created in the form of a
referral with a description of "Sign Up Bonus", which can be viewed from the
Affiliates &rarr; Referrals screen in the admin. The affiliate will see this on
the "Unpaid Earnings" and "Referrals" sections of their affiliate dashboard.

When "Require approval" is enabled from AffiliateWP's settings, the affiliate
will not receive the sign up bonus until their application is approved.
Likewise, if you manually add an affiliate from within the admin, the sign up
bonus is not created until they are approved.

AffiliateWP v1.7 introduced the ability to manually add an affiliate (from the admin) with
an affiliate status. If the "pending" status is chosen, the sign up bonus will
not be created until the affiliate has been approved.

If you're using AffiliateWP 1.7 or higher you'll also see 2 new fields on the
add affiliate screen:

Sign Up Bonus - Allows you to enable or disable the sign up bonus on a per-affiliate
basis

Sign Up Bonus Amount - Allows you to set the sign up bonus on a per-affiliate basis,
overriding the global sign up bonus setting.

Note: It would be a good idea to include information in your affiliate terms
and conditions about a minimum payout amount, or you'll have affiliates joining
and requesting a payout straight away.
